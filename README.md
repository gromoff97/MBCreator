# MBCreator
This is simple SQL code which creates tables for database (theme is "Mount&Blade"), relations between them, then fill it and create triggers for further proper working

## Why?
This code was written a long time ago ( approximately in the middle of 2017 ) just for fun.

## How to test it?
Probably you need to use PostgreSQL. Honestly speaking, other information can be googled easily.
